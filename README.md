# ✉️ IAMO Email Signature Generator

A signature **App** designed by AAW department in IAMO to generate standardized email signatures for the department staff. The app collects your details (prefix, name, profession, phone extension, and email) and produces a ready-to-use **rendered email signature** with a preview and copy button.

## 📸 Features  
- ✅ Choose or enter a **custom prefix** (`Dr.`, `Professor`, or custom).  
- ✅ Separate fields for **first name** and **family name**.  
- ✅ Collects the **last 3 digits** of your phone number (base fixed: `+49 345 2928-XXX`).  
- ✅ Uses only the **local part** of your IAMO email (`@iamo.de` is fixed).  
- ✅ Automatically formats IAMO links:  
  - With profile → shows `www.iamo.de/familyname`.  
  - Without profile → shows `www.iamo.de` (links to IAMO home).  
- ✅ Preview your signature live and copy the HTML with one click.
